\subsection{Non functional requirement}
Users can interact with our system through the mobile application, the website and the display located inside the car.

\subsubsection{View available car information in mobile application} This mockup shows how the information of an available car (charge level and distance from the client) can be displayed on the mobile app. The logged client has the possibility to reserve the car by tapping on the "Reserve" button.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{View map on the website} This mockup shows the map that a generic user (guest or client) can see on the PowerEnJoy website.On the map are displayed the boundaries of the safe area in which a client can leave the car and the charging stations with the number of available charging spots.The user can insert an address in order to see the available cars within a certain distance.

\subsection{The world and the machine}

“The World and the Machine” model by M. Jackson and P. Zave is useful to identify the entities in the portion of system that has to be developed (\textbf{The Machine}) , the entities inside the portion of the real-world affected by the Machine (\textbf{The World}), and all  the \textbf{Shared Phenomena} that are controlled by the world and observed by the machine  or controlled by the machine and observed by the world.
