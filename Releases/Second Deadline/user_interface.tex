\subsection{Mockups}
Users can interact with our system through the mobile application, the website and the display located inside the car.

\subsubsection*{View available car information in mobile application} This mockup shows how the information of an available car (charge level and distance from the client) can be displayed in the mobile app. The logged client has the possibility to reserve the car by tapping on the "Reserve" button.

\subsubsection*{View map on the website} This mockup shows the map that a generic user (guest or client) can see on the PowerEnJoy website. On the map are displayed the boundaries of the safe areas in which a client can leave the car and the charging stations with the number of available charging spots. The user can insert an address in order to see the available cars within a certain distance.
