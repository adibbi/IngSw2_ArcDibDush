\subsection{Purpose	and	scope}
The purpose of this document is to give to the test team some precise guidelines to follow in order to accomplish the testing phase. In particular this document will focus on the integration of the various components presented in the \textbf{Design Document}.
These tests aim to find possible errors in the cooperation between components.
In the following sections are provided which criteria must be met before starting the integration test phase, the elements to be integrated, the strategy that will be used during the integration test phase, the sequence of integration.
Then for each integration between components or subsystems will be specified the tests to run and the expected behavior of our system, the stubs that must be implemented and the test data to be produced in order to accomplish these tests.
