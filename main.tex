\section{Introduction}
bla bla
\subsection{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
\item A client can register to the system by providing an e-mail, any valid payment method and a photo of his driving license.

\item A client can access to his profile.

\item Allows clients to obtain information about
the position of available cars, safe areas and charging stations; about the remaining charge of cars and the available plugs of the charging stations.

\item If Clients donâ€™t have another active reservation they can choose a car that fit most their needs and reserve it for up one hour.

\item A client can start the renting opening a car that has reserved previously when he/she is in the near by.

\item During the rent a client can display the amount of money charged.

\item Guarantee as many available cars as possible encouraging clients to have a virtuous and eco-friendly behavior applying fees and discounts.

\item Allows the client to end the rental and leave the car in any safe area.

\item Clients can report eventual damages made by themselves or by users that have driven the car before.

\item Clients can set the money saving option that suggest a charging station based on the car distribution and the destination selected by the client.

%\item Clients can communicate eventual car accidents or malfunctions.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Domain assumption}
We suppose that these properties hold in the analyzed world :
\begin{itemize}
\item All cars have a stable GPS signal.
\item Clients shares their position when they use the application.
\item PowerEnJoy always has updated data about all the cars and the power stations.
\item The power grid always guarantees electric power.
\item The only method to enter in a car is by the doors.
\item Client knows how to drive a car.
\item The company cars have at least 4 seats.
\item The streets are correctly mapped in the system.
\item All cars have stable internet connection.
\item The charging sensor reflects the real charge of the car in real-time.
\item The real charge of parked cars stays the same over time. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Some examples to get started}

\subsection{How to include Figures}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{resources/polimi.png}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This was uploaded via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.
