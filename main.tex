\subsection{Goals}

%\textbf{Clients :}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A client can register to the system by providing an e-mail, any valid payment method and a photo of his driving license.

\item A client can log in in to system.

%\item 2 The system ,after verifies that the information of a new user are valid, send them a password and allow the user for rent a car.
%\item 2 bis : The system complete the registration and send back a password only if the user can be able to drive the proposed cars.

\item Clients can display available cars with the remaining charge near their current location (or a chosen address) with a maximum specified distance.Clients can display safe areas on a map and charging stations.

\item If Clients don’t have another active reservation they can choose a car that fit most their needs and reserve it for up one hour.

\item A client can start the renting opening a car that has reserved previously when he/she is in the near by.

\item During the rent a client can display the amount of money charged.%we must define "rent" in the glossary  

\item Guarantee as many available cars as possible encouraging clients to have a virtuous and eco-friendly behavior applying fees and discounts. %TODO : glossary good behavior

\item A client can leave the car in any safe area.Allows the client to end the rental.

\item Clients can report eventual damages made by themselves or by users that have driven the car before.

\item Clients can set the money saving option that suggest a charging station based on the car distribution and the destination selected by the client.

%\item Clients can communicate eventual car accidents or malfunctions.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{comment}

\textbf{Operator: }
\begin{enumerate}

\item Operators can see the status, charge level and location about all the cars.

\item Operators can open cars and drive them without paying.

\item Operators can set a car not available for maintenance proposes.   

\item Operators can display a list of cars that have a percentage of charge lower than 20\%.

\end{enumerate}
\end{comment}

\newpage

\begin{comment}
Which user groups are supported by the system to perform their work?
Which user groups execute the system’s main functions?
Which user groups perform secondary functions such as maintenance and administration?
With what external hardware or software system will the system-to-be interact?
What are the primary tasks that the system needs to perform?
What data will the actor create, store, change, remove or add in the system?
What external changes does the system need to know about?
What changes or events will the actor of the system need to be informed about?

\subsection{How to include Figures}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{resources/polimi.png}
\caption{\label{fig:frog}This was uploaded via the project menu.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{How to add Tables}

Use the table and tabular commands for basic tables --- see Table~\ref{tab:widgets}, for example. 

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{l|r}
Item & Quantity \\\hline
Widgets & 42 \\
Gadgets & 13
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{tab:widgets}An example table.}
\end{table}

\subsection{How to write Mathematics}

\LaTeX{} is great at typesetting mathematics. Let $X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_n$ be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables with $\text{E}[X_i] = \mu$ and $\text{Var}[X_i] = \sigma^2 < \infty$, and let
\[S_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}
      = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i}^{n} X_i\]
denote their mean. Then as $n$ approaches infinity, the random variables $\sqrt{n}(S_n - \mu)$ converge in distribution to a normal $\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)$.

\subsection{How to add Citations and a References List}

You can upload a \verb|.bib| file containing your BibTeX entries, created with JabRef; or import your \href{https://www.overleaf.com/blog/184}{Mendeley}, CiteULike or Zotero library as a \verb|.bib| file. You can then cite entries from it, like this: \cite{greenwade93}. Just remember to specify a bibliography style, as well as the filename of the \verb|.bib|.

You can find a \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help/97-how-to-include-a-bibliography-using-bibtex}{video tutorial here} to learn more about BibTeX.
